# Data-analytics-Portfolio
Welcome! This is my data analytics portfolio where  I apply data skills to solve real-world business problems.
With a background in IT and a growing focus on data, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights using tools like SQL, Excel, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. This portfolio highlights my ability to:
Clean and structure messy datasets,
Perform deep exploratory data analysis (EDA),
Build dashboards and visualizations that tell meaningful stories, and
Translate numbers into clear business decisions
